# Gravity Simulation
This is a gravity simulation for a ball being dropped with a velocity in a downward and sideways direction simulating a ball bouncing and energy dissipation. This can very clearly be changed to more realistic energy loss formulae and make it more realistic for each shape using vectors and angles.
